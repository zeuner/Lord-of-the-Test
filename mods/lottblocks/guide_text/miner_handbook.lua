	"\\\nFellow brothers," ..
	"\\\nI have decided to document my years of mining experience, so that it may be of help to future miners, and aid them in easily finding and identifying certain ores."..
	"\\\nThis handbook is the result of several years of my work and dedication. I hope you find it to be of great use."..
	"\\\nThis first volume contains common ores and minerals - where to find them and how to identify them."..
	"\\\n"..
	"\\\nCoal"..
	"\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------" ..
	"\\\nUsed as fuel to power everything from the smallest campfire to largest of dwarven forges. There's no doubt coal is the most essential ore."..
	"\\\nThat is fortunate, since coal is the most common ore which can be found."..
	"\\\nIt is found in moderate quantities anywhere below sea level."..
	"\\\n"..
	"\\\nLimestone"..
	"\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------" ..
	"\\\nWhen fired in a furnace, limestone become a rigid, white and shiny stone called marble."..
	"\\\nIt has been used to built the most magnificent and stunning cities."..
	"\\\nSeveral great cities of Gondor including the grand Minas Tirith were built from this."..
	"\\\nIt is found in large quantities anywhere under 10 metres below sea level."..
	"\\\n"..
	"\\\nTin"..
	"\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------" ..
	"\\\nAs it is a weak metal by itself, tin is mostly used for decorative purposes."..
	"\\\nBut it still functions well enough for cheap tools and armour."..
	"\\\nTin ingots can be combined with copper ingots in a dual furnace to produce bronze, which is significantly stronger for tools and armour."..
	"\\\nIt can be found in small quantities 20 metres below sea level, and its quantity increases to moderate quantities at 60 metres below sea level."..
	"\\\n"..
	"\\\nCopper"..
	"\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------" ..
	"\\\nMuch like tin, copper is a weak metal by itself, although slightly stronger."..
	"\\\nIt suffices for cheap tools and armours."..
	"\\\nCopper ingots can be combined with tin ingots in a dual furnace to produce the alloy of bronze, which is significantly stronger for tools and armour."..
	"\\\nOne may find it in small quantities 16 metres below sea level, with its quantity increasing at 64 metres under sea level."..
	"\\\n"..
	"\\\nIron"..
	"\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------" ..
	"\\\nIron can be smelted into steel, which is a durable and strong metal."..
	"\\\nOn account of its relatively common occurrence and reasonable strength, it is a very good material to use for everyday tools, weapons and armour."..
	"\\\nIt can be found in very small quantities 2 metres below sea level, with the quantity increasing at 16 metres below sea level, and again at 64 metres under the level of the sea."..
	"\\\n"..
	"\\\nOrc Iron"..
	"\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------" ..
	"\\\nOrc Iron is normal iron which has been corrupted by constant volcanic eruptions."..
	"\\\nIt is mostly used by orcs to create their weapons."..
	"\\\nThis variant of iron is much weaker than normal iron."..
	"\\\nBut smelting two of these together in a Dual Furnace will result a normal steel ingot."..
	"\\\nIt can only be found in Mordor, in large quantities, from 5 metres below sea level."..
	"\\\nBut from 100 metres below sea level, the iron is deep enough to not be corrupted, so orc iron do not exists deeper than that."..
	"\\\n"..
	"\\\nSalt"..
	"\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------" ..
	"\\\nUsed for preserving food and making it tastier."..
	"\\\nIt can also be eaten by itself."..
	"\\\nIt is found in riverbeds, at only 5 metres below sealevel, embedded into dirt.\"}"
