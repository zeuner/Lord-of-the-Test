	"\\\nBring a sword and be prepared to fight when you venture into this region."..
	"\\\nNormal green grass is present in this region."..
	"\\\nDunland itself doesn't have much to offer, lacking of any normal fauna and flora except for some normal trees about."..

	"\\\nThe deep, dark Mirkwood forest. A dangerous place for anyone to wander about."..

	"\\\nTheir potent poison that is quite sought after, can be collected with a glass bottle."..
	"\\\nOvergrown trees cover the land, leaving most of the forest in darkness."..
	"\\\nDark green grass is present in this region."..
	"\\\nRarely, you might stumble upon a Mirkwood Elven hut, the old inhabitants of this forest before the spider infestation."..
	"\\\nMirkwood Elves are a cautious but friendly people, preferring to live in seclusion. They are a strong, wise and resistent race, and might be willing to offer great advice and assistance if you get them to trust you enough.."..

	"\\\nEffects of this can still be found, with the Sergeon flowers here having been turned blood red from the blood of the many slaughtered men."..
	"\\\nThe Witch King's forces guard this land now; Orcs, Trolls, Half-Trolls; slaughtering anyone who attempts to reclaim this land."..

	"\\\nAt night, these creatures venture out, looking for fresh meat, and anyone who is foolish enough to enter this snow filled wasteland is likely to meet his end at their hands."..
	"\\\nThere is nothing to be found here apart from cold and death."..

	"\\\nThe occasional Half-Troll, a vicious creature, ventures here during the dark, most likely in search of prey."..
	"\\\nBut night is when this land is truly dangerous."..
	"\\\nAs the region is named, Trollshaws, this region is the home of the Trolls, gigantic, evil creatures with skin as hard as stone."..
