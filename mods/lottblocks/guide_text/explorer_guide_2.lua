	"\\\nPreface"..
	"\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------" ..
	"\\\nSince the young age of 16. I have devoted my life to travelling the vast regions of Middle Earth and document even the most inaccessible of areas."..
	"\\\nThis book is a compilation of my entire life of work."..
	"\\\nMany thanks to all the people I have met along the way who offered their hospitality to me."..
	"\\\nThanks to my Elven companion, Devdan, who accompanied me for half of my travels."..
	"\\\nThanks also to guards, Merek, Roran and Rulf, who helped as we ventured into the more dangerous regions."..
	"\\\n "..
	"\\\nIntroduction"..
	"\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------" ..
	"\\\nThis is volume two of three of a work which documents my travels through Middle Earth." ..
	"\\\nThis volume records my venture through the regions of Middle Earth which are more guarded, and inhabited by more cautious people."..
	"\\\nI have categorised information about each location neatly. From local inhabitants to notable towns and even interesting areas I have discovered, all are included."..
	"\\\nI hope all this will be of a great help to you, future explorer."..
	"\\\nWithout further ado, let's turn the page, and explore the wonders of Middle Earth!"..
	"\\\n "..
	"\\\nIthilien"..
	"\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------" ..
	"\\\nA grassland forest filled with a variety of flora and fauna."..
	"\\\nThe land is mostly void of inhabitants except for the occasional Ithilien ranger, a member of a group of people who attempt to guard this empty land."..
	"\\\nAt nighttime, raiding orcs will venture into the region, make sure to be on your guard."..
	"\\\nAt first glance it might look similar to the Shire."..
	"\\\nBut the grass is much darker here and no hobbits wander this land."..
	"\\\nMost notable feature is the culumalda tree, red trees with yellow blossoms that are unique here and decorate the region."..
	"\\\n "..
	"\\\nGondor"..
	"\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------" ..
	"\\\nThe ancient kingdom of men."..
	"\\\nHere there are mostly plains with the occasional tree."..
	"\\\nGreat white Gondorian forts decorate the region. Serving as protection against frequent raids from the orcs."..
	"\\\nGondorian soldiers patrol around the region, hoping to deter any orc from roaming in their lands."..
	"\\\nBut when the night turns, groups of raiding orcs venture into the region. Watch your back and make sure to stay near the patrols of Gondorian soldiers."..
	"\\\nNormal green grass is found in this region."..
	"\\\nIt's easy to identify from the scarcity of fauna as compared to other regions, a result of past mass deforestation by the men. But if you are lucky, you might find a fabled white tree..."..
	"\\\n "..
	"\\\nRohan"..
	"\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------" ..
	"\\\nThe great grassland plains of the Horse Lords."..
	"\\\nHorses gallop over these great grassland plains, with the occasional Rohirrim soldier patrolling by."..
	"\\\nSmall wooden forts can be spotted occasionally, guarding the land against the attacks of the enemy."..
	"\\\nFauna and flora are mostly scarce, as a result of the hot sun scorching the land."..
	"\\\nAt night, some raiding orcs wander into the region, so watch your back."..
	"\\\nBrown withered grass is found in this region, but there are occasional patches of green."..
	"\\\nScorched red desert stone is also found on cliff faces instead of normal stone, perhaps a portent of the future of this land."..
	"\\\n "..
	"\\\nFangorn"..
	"\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------" ..
	"\\\nFangorn is what's left of the great forest that used to extend throughout the whole continent of Middle Earth."..
	"\\\nThe mass deforestation by its various inhabitants saw the great forest dwindle into its current state, Fangorn."..
	"\\\nDon't get me wrong though. Fangorn is still a massive forest, with fauna of all sorts and kind."..
	"\\\nTall elm trees sprout out of the forest canopy."..
	"\\\nRowan trees, brown trees with distinctive red berries, that used to be found throughout Middle-Earth, can only be found here now."..
	"\\\nAs you venture across the forest, you might spot trees moving."..
	"\\\nNo, you haven't had too many pints of Hobbitish ale, but ancient tree guardians, 'Ents', protect this ancient, great forest."..
	"\\\nAs long as you don't bother either them or the trees, the Ents are likely to leave you alone, just don't approach too close."..
	"\\\nUnder the cover of night, Uruk Hai with their wicked black armour, forces of Saruman, venture into the land, to gather wood for their furnaces to power their war machines. Make sure to avoid them if you don't want to get caught in the middle of their sharp orc blades.\"}"
