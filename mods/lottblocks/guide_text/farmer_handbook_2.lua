	"\\\nMushrooms!" ..
	"\\\nThe best thing since sliced bread! Every Hobbit loves them!"..
	"\\\nFarming them isn't difficult but there are just a few steps to follow."..
	"\\\nAfterwhich, you will have an endless supply of mushrooms! How wonderful!"..
	"\\\n "..
	"\\\nGetting Essentials"..
	"\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------" ..
	"\\\nFirst you need to find some trees."..
	"\\\nThese will provide a base for the mushrooms to grow on."..
	"\\\nOnly normal, oak, trees work, the wood of any special variant would not have the right composition for the mushroom to grow on."..
	"\\\nChop down the tree and get some of the tree bark."..
	"\\\nThat will be the base on which the yummy mushrooms will grow."..
	"\\\n "..
	"\\\nNext, you need some fertiliser for the mushroom to grow healthily."..
	"\\\nThe special ingredient is the bones of the dead! Wonderful!"..
	"\\\nBones and decaying flesh will work nicely."..
	"\\\nBut if you can't locate that you can grind up the remains of an old gravestone too. nAnd put it into a glass container to store it."..
	"\\\n "..
	"\\\nThe following craft recipe should help:"..
	"\\\nGL = Glass / GR = Gravestone / NT = Nothing"..
	"\\\n"..
	"\\\nGL, NT, GL"..
	"\\\nGL, GR, GL"..
	"\\\nGL, GL, GL"..
	"\\\n "..
	"\\\nOnce you get all that settled, it's time to find some wild mushrooms so you can get some spores for your farm!"..
	"\\\nYou will find some easily around here at Shire and in most grasslands."..
	"\\\n "..
	"\\\nStarting your first Mushroom Farm"..
	"\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------" ..
	"\\\nWith the tree bark, bacteria fertiliser and spores in hand, you can start your first mushroom farm!"..
	"\\\nAh, I still remember the day I started mine. What a marvellous day that was!"..
	"\\\n "..
	"\\\nAnyway. First, you must find a dark area, as mushrooms need dark areas to grow."..
	"\\\nMake sure that you don't even leave any torches nearby, as their light is enough to make the mushrooms wither."..
	"\\\nNext, place the bacteria fertiliser onto the tree bark."..
	"\\\nSome white, green and orange liquid should be applied on the top of it now."..
	"\\\nNow simply place your mushroom spores above!"..
	"\\\nAnd now, just wait for them to grow!"..
	"\\\nCongratulations, you have your first mushroom farm!"..
	"\\\n "..
	"\\\nNow just wait for them to grow and you will have your very-own homegrown mushrooms."..
	"\\\nI like to eat mushrooms raw, but there are much more ways to enjoy them."..
	"\\\nIf you have three of the same type of mushroom and a bowl, you can squash them into a cream of mushroom soup. Yummy!"..
	"\\\n "..
	"\\\nThis concludes all you need to know about farming mushrooms."..
	"\\\nEnjoy the mushrooms of your labour!\"}"
