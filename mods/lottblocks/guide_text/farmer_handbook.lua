	"\\\nFood!"..
	"\\\nAll of us Hobbits love it!"..
	"\\\nIt's good for everything! When you're at home, in a party, meeting up with friends, in a gathering."..
	"\\\nThere's no occasion which some food would spoil!"..
	"\\\nThis handbook will teach you how to grow your very own supply of food."..
	"\\\n "..
	"\\\nGetting Essentials"..
	"\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------" ..
	"\\\nFirstly find a good plot of land with dirt or grass."..
	"\\\nThis will be where your crops will grow on."..
	"\\\n "..
	"\\\nMake sure you have some water nearby."..
	"\\\nCrops need water to grow."..
	"\\\n "..
	"\\\nMake sure the area gets sufficient sunlight too."..
	"\\\nYou need the crops to have direct exposure to the sun to grow healthily."..
	"\\\n "..
	"\\\nNext, you need some seeds."..
	"\\\nSeeds aren't too hard to find. There's a huge variety of them."..
	"\\\nTo find some, simply venture around some local grasslands or forests."..
	"\\\nYou will find wild variety of growing wild foods, grab some and they should drop some seeds for you. Otherwise, crafting them will yield some seeds too."..
	"\\\n "..
	"\\\nWith the land, water, sunlight and seeds, you are ready to start your first farm!"..
	"\\\n "..
	"\\\nStarting your first Farm"..
	"\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------" ..
	"\\\nFirstly, craft a hoe."..
	"\\\nYou need a hoe to till the land for crops."..
	"\\\nSimply rightclick on any piece of dirt or grass while wielding the hoe."..
	"\\\nThe dirt or grass should turn into a piece of farmland."..
	"\\\n"..
	"\\\nNext make sure the farmland is wet."..
	"\\\nIf it is wet enough, the farmland should turn darker."..
	"\\\nIf it doesn't turn any darker, simply add some water nearby."..
	"\\\n"..
	"\\\nHaving the wet farmland, you can now place your seeds on top."..
	"\\\nBe patient and they will start growing."..
	"\\\nAnd after soon, you will get your very first harvest!"..
	"\\\n"..
	"\\\nTypes of Crops"..
	"\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------" ..
	"\\\nThere are many foods you can farm, some of which are more filling than others."..
	"\\\n "..
	"\\\nFrom my years of experience, here's a list of foods, from the least filling to most filling food, some of which need to be cooked before they can be eaten:"..
	"\\\n - Berries"..
	"\\\n - Raw Potato"..
	"\\\n - Cooked Barley"..
	"\\\n - Slice of Melon"..
	"\\\n - Cooked Turnips"..
	"\\\n - Cooked Tomato"..
	"\\\n - Cabbage"..
	"\\\n - Corn"..
	"\\\n - Bread (made from wheat)"..
	"\\\n - Cooked Potato"..
	"\\\n"..
	"\\\nYou can of course craft more complex food with some of these, which makes them even taster and more filling!"..
	"\\\nConsult the crafting books for those."..
	"\\\n"..
	"\\\nThere are some special crops that are used for specific purposes, which sadly can't be eaten."..
	"\\\n"..
	"\\\nCotton is used to craft wool and string for clothes and such."..
	"\\\nAthelas is used as a herb to brew potions."..
	"\\\nPipeweed is used for smoking. We will look at this some more in the next section."..
	"\\\n "..
	"\\\nAll about Pipeweed"..
	"\\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------" ..
	"\\\nPipeweed, with its sweet and fragrant blossoms. Smoking some in a pipe will leave a sweet taste in your mouth."..
	"\\\nIt's been known to enhance your health too! Some of the oldest hobbits smoke them on a regular basis."..
	"\\\n "..
	"\\\nFarming pipeweed is very similar to other crops."..
	"\\\nWild pipeweed can only be found in Shire."..
	"\\\nBright green plants with lovely yellow blossoms, which are easily spotted."..
	"\\\n "..
	"\\\nOnce you have some pipeweed, simply cook it up."..
	"\\\nCraft a pipe next, with the following recipe;"..
	"\\\nW = Wood / S = Stick / N = Nothing"..
	"\\\nN, N, S"..
	"\\\nW, S, N"..
	"\\\nS, N, N"..
	"\\\n"..
	"\\\nWith a pipe and cooked pipeweed, you are now ready to smoke pipeweed!"..
	"\\\nHold the pipe in your hand and put the cooked pipeweed to the right of it."..
	"\\\nGive it a punch and blow, and there you have it, your very first smoke ring!"..
	"\\\n"..
	"\\\n"..
	"\\\nThis concludes all your need to know about farming!"..
	"\\\nEnjoy the fruits of your labour!\"}"
